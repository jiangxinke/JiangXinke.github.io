excerpt: 'As urban populations and mobility demands grow, effective urban traffic risk prediction becomes essential for enhancing transport management, ensuring safe urban mobility, and fostering urban resilience. While statistical and deep learning models show potential for real-time accident prediction, they still face two fundamental challenges: addressing zero-inflated issues at the micro-level risk situation and incorporating real-world urban structures from spatio-temporal perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Model framework, that predicts traffic accidents simultaneously at two finer levels: regions of Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) and individual nodes such as road segments, POI locations, or cycling infrastructure. The heterogeneous graph provides a comprehensive representation of the urban system, and cross-level graph contrastive learning enables joint optimization of node and region spatio-temporal embeddings. Our modified focal loss function effectively mitigates common zero-inflated issues. We extensively evaluated our proposed model on three scenarios of urban traffic accident datasets in Inner London, UK. The results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models in both region-level traffic risk mapping and node-level accident occurrence identification, particularly for sparser cycling-involved accidents. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in promoting traffic safety and urban resilience.'
