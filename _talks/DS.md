The increasing complexity of traffic situations, coupled with the rapid growth of urban populations, necessitates the development of innovative solutions that can mitigate congestion, reduce traffic-related accidents, and facilitate smoother transportation systems. Recognizing the significant impact of ChatGPT and computer vision technologies on various domains, it is timely to investigate how these advancements can be harnessed to address the critical challenges in urban transportation safety and efficiency.

With this motivation, we introduce DriveScenify, an approach that aims to boost driving scene understanding by leveraging advanced vision-language models. Our research focuses on developing a tailored version of MiniGPT-4, called DSify, which is specifically designed to process and generate contextually relevant responses based on driving scene videos. DriveScenify's integration of advanced vision-language models into the realm of transportation aims to unlock new possibilities for improving urban mobility, reducing traffic-related accidents, and enhancing the overall driving experience.

Furthermore, our unique combination among various encoders enables DSify to provide accurate and context-aware insights, which can be applied to various transportation applications, especially for traffic management, and road safety analysis.
